With iTunes, Apple had drawn the blueprint for distributing music, movies, books, and apps over the web. By supplying and tying together a music player, online store, and song-mangement software, Apple drastically simplified the entire music experience, defying the odds to build a music-retailing dynasty even as file sharing skyrocketed. A decade ago, Apple started to answer what would become an all-important question: how do you get consumers to pay for content again?

"They invented the digital music business," said Michael Nash, the former digital chief at Warner Music Group. "Apple really created the convergence of music and technology and showed everyone what the connected economy around content looks like."

Now known simply as the iTunes Store, the music, movie, TV, book, and app marketplace celebrates its 10-year anniversary on April 28th. Few should be singing Happy Birthday with more zeal than those at the major entertainment companies. And now, as the iTunes Store enters its second decade, thereâ€™s a growing sentiment that iTunes has become bloated and stagnant, that Apple is resting on its laurels and failing to innovate while a new generation of music services begin to find an audience. Over the next ten years, will the company be able to evolve its longstanding business model and keep dominating in the face of upstart competitors?
